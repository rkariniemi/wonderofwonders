Get ActiveState perl at R:\Tools\Perl

Execute the ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi file in that directory;

If you have a 64 bit machine, use the http://www.activestate.com/activeperl website and download that version;


Perl Package Manager (PPM) is a gui utility to download pwerl packages. It is part of the activestate perl distribution.

There is no Win32::SerialPort package for 64 bit, so use the 32 bit version and the force flag if necessary. The instructions on downloading and building the package are here:

To run the test script;

Copy the Fog Test Suite folder to a directory on the PC which will be used for testing
Note it includes the follwing files:

BitErrors.pl
BitErrorValues.pl
Configtypes.pl
SetImuSysConfig.pl
TestDspImu.pl
testSequence.txt
FOGTest.bat
Command Prompt

Note it includes the follwing folders:
TestResultArchive
TestFilterFiles


Use the COM port connected to the device; it is advisable to check COM port connection to the device using putty, hyperterm, or realterm;

Open the command window:

To get the help menu:

   perl TestDspImu.pl COM4 -HM  


To run all of the standartd tests:   perl TestDspImu.pl COM4


To run the testfilt command:   perl TestDspImu.pl COM4 -TF Note: This test takes a few hours to complete


To run the TestBit command:   perl TestDspImu.pl COM4 -BIT Note: This test takes about 45 minutes to complete
 

To run an individual test, use the help menu to determine the mnemonic:

Example: To test just the software version test:   perl TestDspImu.pl COM4 -W


To run all available tests (Standard, testfilt, TestBit) for all device types automatically overnight for Jenkins software verification or new software release verification: 

Edit the FOGTest.bat file to update the comm port to the correct number for each command line in the file

Make sure you are connected to a FOG IMU device (1775, 1750, 1725).

Run the FOGTest.bat file. It will test each of the 10 varients of the 1775 board based FOG devices (IMUs DSPs IRS); Note: This test will take 12 to 15 hours to complete
  

The new test directory generated will use the device type and the date to form the directory name and create it in the TestResultArchive folder;
Note: a .zip file of the test results will also be generated.

For Example:
1750IMU_10_17_2014_15_33_31 is the directory of the test as it is a 1750IMU and the date of the test is 10-17-2014 at 3:33:31 (H:M:S) 

 
The tests will generate the following files in the test directory and .zip file if all the tests are run:

For a 1750 IMU with only one format
 
IMU_1750IMU_10_20_2014_10_5_14.csv    	- CSV file with results of the test
testHelpConfig.txt		- Text File with dump of the Help menu in CONFIG mode
testHelpDebug.txt		- Text File with dump of the Help menu in DEBUG mode
testNormalA.txt			- Text File with hex dump of the FORMAT A in Normal Mode
testNormalBIT.txt               - Text File with hex dump of the FORMAT A BIT in Normal Mode    
testFailedResults.txt		- Text file with a list of all tests that failed

For a 1775 IMU 
 
IMU_1775IMU_10_17_2014_15_30_9.csv    	- CSV file with results of the test
testHelpConfig.txt		- Text File with dump of the Help menu in CONFIG mode
testHelpDebug.txt		- Text File with dump of the Help menu in DEBUG mode
testNormalA.txt			- Text File with hex dump of the FORMAT A in Normal Mode
testNormalB.txt			- Text File with hex dump of the FORMAT B in Normal Mode
testNormalC.txt			- Text File with hex dump of the FORMAT C in Normal Mode
testNormalBIT.txt               - Text File with hex dump of the FORMAT A BIT in Normal Mode    
testFailedResults.txt		- Text file with a list of all tests that failed

Same test file format applies to the DSP and IRS series of products, with the applicable files being generated based upon the device type

The tests will generate the following files in the test directory if the testsfilts command tests are run:

Notes: There are individual text files generated for the testfilt command that capture the Accel and Gyros samples; 

Each of these text files will generate seperate xlsx files based on the filter type and the data rate;

For example, the IMU1775_Avg_10.txt file is generatred from the testfilt command;
That file will be used to generate the IMU1775_Avg_10_accel.xlsx and 
IMU1775_Avg_10_gyro.xlsx
